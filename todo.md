- update anthropology (accent marks, absolute pitches)

- write jazz chord symbol notation page
- update intro page text to flow across multiple pages (break into multiple columns?)
- clarify and standardize tempo meanings (what exactly does "bright" mean vs "fast" or "medium up" ?)
- do a pass on fonts

- generate indexes for author/year/type
- midi generation
- restructure templates to account for multiple staves easily
  - possibly overhaul template system to just add %%TRANSPOSE%% manually, idk
- figure out how to control stave spacing per song (via overrides)

- [x] fix spellings for half-diminished chords (use proper symbol to reduce clutter)
  - very low priority: make optional
- fix spellings for alt chords
- fix spellings for 7sus4 / 9sus4 chords
- fix ImproVoice embellishments/markings
